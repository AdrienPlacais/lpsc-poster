## LPSC poster

This is a beamer template for posters with LPSC colors.
It is based on [Gemini](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini) theme.

As such, it requires the beamerposter package to be installed.
It should be the case if you manage your installation with texlive.
If not, check the version of your distribution.
You can always get it from [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamerposter).
